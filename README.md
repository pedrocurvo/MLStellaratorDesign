# Machine Learning for Stellarator Design

The design of fusion reactors with a stellarator configuration can be enormously simplified using a framework called the near-axis expansion. A Python code that leverages such simplification has been developed that is now routinely used to design new machines. From a set of input parameters, the code produces a new design, which can be assessed in terms of its characteristics, such as confinement and complexity of the geometry. However, to achieve a design with certain characteristics, one must find the appropriate input parameters. The goal of this work is to use machine learning, e.g. a neural network, to map the desired characteristics of the device to the corresponding parameters required to generate the device. This includes the development of a dataset of configurations and the training of the neural network on such dataset.
